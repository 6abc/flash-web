# Save it as [hello.py] or something similar. Make sure to not call your application flask.py because this would conflict with Flask itself.

# Application Discovery Behavior
# As a shortcut, if the file is named app.py or wsgi.py, you donâ€™t have to use --app. See Command Line Interface for more details.
